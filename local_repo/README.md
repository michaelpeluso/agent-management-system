# Program Snippets
Here is a colleciton of small programming projects I have developed over the past years. Below is a brief explanation for each directory. View them individually to see a more in-depth description of each.

- ### Binary-to-Float
This repository contains two C programs that facilitate the conversion between floating-point numbers and their binary representations. The programs are named ftob.c and btof.c.

- ### BinarySearchTree
This Java project provides an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST is a fundamental data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and removal of elements, providing an average-case time complexity of O(log n) for these operations.

- ### Processor-Simulation
This Python program simulates task scheduling in an operating system environment. It supports three scheduling algorithms: Serial Computing (SC), Timesharing (TS), and Multitasking (MT). The program reads configuration details from a file named config.txt.
