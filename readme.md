## Project Overview
This project is a GitHub README.md generator. It generates a comprehensive README.md file for your Github repository based on a set of provided code snippets. The generated README.md is designed to be comprehensive and long, filling more than a page.

## Features
- Generates a custom README.md file
- Interprets and describes the goal of your code
- Extracts relevant information from your code snippets
- Provides a visual file structure tree using `file_structure.json`

## Setup and Execution Instructions

1. **Start Python Virtual Environment:**
Open a terminal window. Navigate to the project directory. Create a new Python virtual environment by running the command:
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install Requirements:**
3. Make sure you are in the virtual environment. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file by running the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Execute Commands:**
To run the application in on your browser, use the following command:
```
python main.py
```
To run the application in debug mode, use the following command:
```
python main.py debug
```
To run the backend functionality in the terminal, use:
```
python main.py backend
```
